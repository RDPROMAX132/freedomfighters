<h1>Mangal Pandey, one of the  first freedom fighters in India, inspired his fellow Indians with the powerful phrase “Maro Firangi Ko.” His courageous uprising catalyzed the 1857 Great Rebellion and the Indian Mutiny, also known as India’s First War of Independence. He played a key role in motivating young Indian soldiers during the Sepoy Mutiny, leaving a lasting impact on India’s fight for freedom.</h1>
