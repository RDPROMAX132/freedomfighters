    <h1>Jawahar Lal Nehru was born on November 14, 1889, in Prayagraj, where he earned the endearing nickname “Chacha Nehru.” His fervor for independence was greatly influenced by Mahatma Gandhi’s endeavors to free India from the British. Starting as a lawyer, Nehru rose to prominence as a politician and advocate for Indian independence. He actively participated in the war for freedom and eventually became the President of the Indian National Congress. When India achieved independence, he was appointed as the country’s first Prime Minister. His affection for children led to the celebration of his birthday as Children’s Day.
