<h1>Ambedkar Jayanti, celebrated on April 14th each year, commemorates the birth anniversary of Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar, fondly known as the ‘Father of the Indian Constitution’. This day holds immense significance as it pays tribute to Dr. Ambedkar’s lifelong dedication to eliminating discrimination and promoting equality.
    Born in 1891, Dr. Ambedkar was not only the principal architect of the Indian Constitution but also held the esteemed position of being the first Law Minister of Independent India. Beyond his political roles, he was a jurist, economist, and a prominent social reformer.
