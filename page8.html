<h1>Lal Bahadur Shastri, one of India’s Top 10 freedom fighters, was born in 1904 in Mughalsarai, Uttar Pradesh. After India gained independence, he continued as the Home Minister before becoming the second Prime Minister of India in 1964. He was a quiet but active freedom fighter, who actively participated in Mahatma Gandhi’s Salt the Earth Civil Disobedience Movement, Satyagraha Movement, and Quit India Movement, enduring imprisonment for his convictions.</h1>
