    <h1>Maulana Abul Kalam Azad’s dedication to the nation extended beyond India’s independence. Participating in India’s independence movement at the young age of 16, he remained an active figure throughout his life. As Congress President, he spearheaded the Quit India Movement. In recognition of his contributions, he was honored with the Bharat Ratna in 1922. Later, in 1947, he became India’s first education minister. Serving the nation for over 50 years, he left a remarkable legacy and passed away on February 22, 1958.
